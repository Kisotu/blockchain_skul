# Blockchain & Solidity Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my learning journey on **Blockchain** concepts and **Solidity** development! This repository documents my progress, notes, projects, and resources as I dive into the world of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).

## 📚 What I am Learning

- **Blockchain Fundamentals**:
  - What is Blockchain? 🛠️
  - How does Blockchain work? 🔐
  - Consensus algorithms: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc. ⚖️
  - Public vs Private blockchains 🏗️
  - Cryptography and Hashing 🧩

- **Solidity Basics**:
  - Introduction to Solidity and its syntax 📝
  - Writing smart contracts 📜
  - Deploying contracts on Ethereum 👨‍💻
  - Understanding gas, events, and modifiers ⛽
  - Interacting with smart contracts using Web3.js 🌐

- **Building dApps**:
  - Frontend and backend integration 🔌
  - Using Truffle and Hardhat for development 🧰
  - Deploying to test networks (Rinkeby, Ropsten) 🧪
  - Security best practices 🛡️

## 🚀 Projects

This repo will showcase the following projects:

- **Simple Token Contract**: A basic ERC-20 token 💵
- **Crowdfunding Contract**: A smart contract for raising funds 📈

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle/Hardhat**: Ethereum development frameworks.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for testing.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet and dApp browser.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum blockchain.
